 * @brief Main header for the geometry library
 * 
 * This header includes all the main components of the geometry library:
 * - Core configuration and types
 * - Primitive geometric shapes (Ray3d, Triangle3d)
 * - Geometric algorithms (intersection functions)
 * 
 * Simply include this single header to access all library functionality.
